# Task 2: Count Words in a File
# Problem Statement:
# Write a program that reads the content of a text file sample.txt,
# counts the number of words in it, and displays the total word count.
# Create a text file sample.txt with any content (e.g., "Hello world!
# This is a file.").
# Open the file in read mode, count the words, and print the result.
# Example Input in sample.txt:
# Hello world! This is a file.

# Expected Output:
# The file contains 6 words.


with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello World! This is a file")

with open("sample.txt") as file:
    file_data = file.read().split()
    print(f"The file contains {len(file_data)} words")
