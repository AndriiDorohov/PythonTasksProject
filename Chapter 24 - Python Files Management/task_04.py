# Task 4: Reading and Writing a CSV File
# Problem:
# Create a program that does the following:
# Write a CSV file named students.csv with columns: Name, Age, and Grade.
# Populate it with at least 3 rows of sample data (e.g., "Alice", 25, "A").
# Read the file and calculate the average age of the students.
# Display the content of the CSV file along with the average age.
# Example Input (Data in students.csv):
# Name,Age,Grade
# Alice,25,A
# Bob,22,B
# Charlie,24,A

# Expected Output:
# File content:
# Name: Alice, Age: 25, Grade: A
# Name: Bob, Age: 22, Grade: B
# Name: Charlie, Age: 24, Grade: A

# Average Age: 23.67
#
